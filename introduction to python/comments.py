#------------------------What Are Comments------------------------------?
# Comments are notes you write in your code that Python completely ignores when running the program. They’re meant for you and other humans to understand what the code is doing.
# Think of comments like sticky notes in a notebook—they help explain things but don’t affect the actual work.

# ------------------------Why Use Comments------------------------------?
           # To explain what your code does
           # To make your code easier to read
           # To leave reminders
           # To temporarily disable parts of code while testing

# ------------------------How to Write Comments in Python? ----------------------- #

# ---------------------Single-Line Comments -------------------------- #
          # Use the (#) symbol to write a comment:
          # This prints a greeting print("Hello, Shivam!")
          # Everything after the # is ignored by Python.
          # You can also write comments at the end of a line:
print("Welcome!") # This is a welcome message

# -----------------------Multi-Line Comments ------------------------- #
          # Python doesn’t have a special multi-line comment symbol, but you can use one of these two methods:
                        # 1. Multiple # lines:
                              # This is a multi-line comment # explaining what the code does # line by line print("Hello again!")
                        # 2. Triple quotes (''' or """):
''' This is a multi-line comment using triple quotes. Python ignores this if it's not assigned to a variable. '''
print("Python is fun!")

# --------------------- Commenting Out Code ---------------------- #
        # You can use comments to disable code without deleting it:
        # print("This line won't run") print("Only this line runs")
        # This is super useful when debugging or testing.
